        <p>Talissa Cabrera is my sister and she’s 29 years old. She’s a 5th grade teacher who recently moved from Phoenix Arizona to Vancouver Washington. In her free time she enjoys listening to music, reading, writing, and spending time with family (especially if it means babysitting her niece). After her recent move to Washington Talissa plans on traveling to nearby attractions and sites. In addition to this Talissa would like to travel to other fascinating places such as Hawaii, England, and Italy just to name a few. Talissa also plans on obtaining her Masters’ degree in order to advance further in the teaching field and to expand her skill set. </p>
